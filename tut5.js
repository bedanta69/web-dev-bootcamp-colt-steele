//strings
//anything under a parenthesis "" or '' is a string
//for example:
let a = "1,2,3,4";
let b = 'a,b,c,d';

//in a string each element has a index number starting from left 
// in a index of 1 is 0 for 2 its 1 and so on

a.length; //.length gives us the length of the string;
a[0]; //gives us the element in the index number 0 of a
